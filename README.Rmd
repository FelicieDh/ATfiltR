# ATfiltR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ATfiltR compiles your acoustic telemetry detection files, removes duplicates (and saves them elsewhere), 
    attributes animal ID to detections (and save tags that don't belong to you elsewhere),
    removes detections outside of the deployment period, removes ghost detections via a 
    "solitary detection" filter (customizable) and a swimming speed filter. 
    Can format the data for use in package RSP.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ATfiltR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FelicieDh/ATfiltR")
```
