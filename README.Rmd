# ATfiltR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ATfiltR compiles your acoustic telemetry detection files, removes duplicates (and saves them elsewhere), 
    attributes animal ID to detections (and save tags that don't belong to you elsewhere),
    removes detections outside of the deployment period, removes ghost detections via a 
    "solitary detection" filter (customizable) and a swimming speed filter. 
    Can format the data for use in package RSP.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ATfiltR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FelicieDh/ATfiltR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ATfiltR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
